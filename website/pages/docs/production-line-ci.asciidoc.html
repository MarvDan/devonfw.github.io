<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Production Line Project is a set of server-side collaboration tools for Capgemini engagements. It has been developed for supporting project engagements with individual tools like issue tracking, continuous integration, continuous deployment, documentation, binary storage and much more!</p>

<h5 id="production-line-ci.asciidoc_introduction">Introduction</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although the PL Project is a wide set of tools, only 3 are going to be mainly used for My Thai Star projects to build a Continuous Integration and Continuos Delivery environment. All three are available in the <a href="https://devon.s2-eu.capgemini.com/#https://devon.s2-eu.capgemini.com/jenkins/">PL instance</a> used for this project.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Jenkins</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is going to be the "main tool". Jenkins helps to automate the non-human part of the development with Continuos Integration and is going to host all Pipelines (and, obviously, execute them).</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nexus</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nexus manages software "artifacts" required for development. It is possible to both download dependencies from Nexus and publish artifacts as well. It allows to share resources within an organization.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>SonarQube</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is a platform for continuous inspection of the code. It is going to be used for the Java back-end.</p>

The Java server-side of My Thai Star is an *devon4j*-based application. As long as *Maven* and a *Java 8* are going to be needed, the Pipeline should have those tools available as well.

[[java-ci.asciidoc_pipeline]]

[[deployment.asciidoc]]
= Deployment

The main deployment tool used for *My Thai Star* is be *Docker*.

image::images/ci/deployment/docker.png[, link="https://www.docker.com/"]

It is a tool to run application in isolated environments. Those _isolated environments_ will be what we call *Docker containers*. For instance, it won't be necessary any installation of *Nginx* or *Apache tomcat* or anything necessary to deploy, because there will be some containers that actually _have_ those technologies inside.

[[deployment.asciidoc_where-docker-containers-will-be-running]]
== Where Docker containers will be running?

Of course, it is necessary to have an external Deployment Server. Every Docker process will run in it. It will be accessed from Production Line pipelines via *SSH*. Thus, the pipeline itself will manage the scenario of, if every previous process like testing passes as OK, stop actual containers and create new ones.

This external server will be located in https://mts-devonfw-core.cloud.okteto.net/

[[deployment.asciidoc_container-schema]]
== Container Schema

3 Docker containers are being used for the deployment of My Thai Star:

1. **Nginx** for the Reverse Proxy
2. **tomcat** for the Java Server
3. **Nginx** for the Angular Client

The usage of the **Reverse Proxy** will allow the client to call via `/api` every single Java Server's REST operation. Moreover, there will only be 1 port in usage in the remote Docker host, the one mapped for the Reverse Proxy: `8080`.
Besides the deployment itself using **Nginx** and **tomcat**, both client and server are previously built using **NodeJS** and **maven** images. Artifacts produced by them will be pasted in servers' containers using multi-stage docker builds. It will all follow this schema:

image::https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20857839/36028242-8998f41c-0d9e-11e8-93b3-6bfe50152bf8.png[, link="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20857839/36028242-8998f41c-0d9e-11e8-93b3-6bfe50152bf8.png"]

This orchestration of all 3 containers will be done by using a `docker-compose.yml` file. To redirect traffic from one container to another (i.e. reverse-proxy to angular client or angular client to java server) will be done by using, as host names, the service name `docker-compose` defines for each of them, followed by the internally exposed port:

- `http://reverse-proxy:80`
- `http://angular:80`
- `http://java:8080`

NOTE: A implementation using xref:traefik-reverse-proxy.asciidoc[Traefik as reverse proxy] instead of NGINX is also available.

[[deployment.asciidoc_run-my-thai-star]]
== Run My Thai Star

The steps to run **My Thai Star** are:

1. Clone the repository `$ git clone https://github.com/devonfw/my-thai-star.git`
2. Run the docker compose command: `$ docker-compose up`

[[deployment-pipelines.asciidoc]]
= Deployment Pipelines

As PL does not support deployments, we have created separate pipelines for this purpose. Those pipelines are: *MyThaiStar_REVERSE-PROXY_DEPLOY*, *MyThaiStar_FRONT-END_DEPLOY* and *MyThaiStar_SERVER_DEPLOY*.

The application will be deployed using docker on a remote machine. The architecture is as follows:

image::images/ci/deployment/deployment_arch.png[, link=images/ci/deployment/deployment_arch.png]

The parts to be deployed are: an NGINX reverse proxy, the java application and the angular application.

[[deployment-pipelines.asciidoc_mythaistar_server_deploy-pipeline]]
== `MyThaiStar_SERVER_DEPLOY Pipeline`

Deploys on the server the Java part of My Thai Star.

[[my-thai-star.wiki_deployment-pipelines.asciidoc_parameters]]
=== Parameters

- `*registryUrl*`: The URL to the docker registry where the image is stored.
- `*registryCredentialsId*`: Credentials to publish/download images from registry.
- `*dockerNetwork*`: Network of your My Thai Star application. You can deploy several versions of MTS in the same server by changing the `dockerNetwork`.
- *VERSION*: The version that you can to deploy.

[[my-thai-star.wiki_deployment-pipelines.asciidoc_pipeline-steps]]
=== Pipeline steps

- *Create docker network*: Create the docker network with the name provided as parameter.
- *Deploy new image*: Deploy a new java container. If it already exists, first it delete the previous one.

[[deployment-pipelines.asciidoc_mythaistar_front-end_deploy]]
== MyThaiStar_FRONT-END_DEPLOY

[[deployment-pipelines.asciidoc_mythaistar_reverse-proxy_deploy-pipeline]]
== `MyThaiStar_REVERSE-PROXY_DEPLOY Pipeline`

NOTE: As reverse proxy connects to the Java and Angular application, both must be deployed before you execute this pipeline.

The `MyThaiStar_REVERSE-PROXY_DEPLOY` pipeline will deploy the My Thai Star reverse proxy into a remote machine using docker.

[[my-thai-star.wiki_deployment-pipelines.asciidoc_parameters_5]]
=== Parameters

- `*registryUrl*`: The URL to the docker registry where the image is stored.
- `*registryCredentialsId*`: Credentials to publish/download images from registry.

[[deployment-strategies.asciidoc]]
= Deployment Strategies

In this chapter different way of deploying My Thai Star are explained. Everything will be based in Docker.

[[deployment-strategies.asciidoc_independent-docker-containers]]
== Independent Docker containers

The first way of deployment will use isolated Docker containers. That means that if the client-side container is deployed, it does not affect the server-side container's life cycle and vice versa.

Let's show how the containers will behave during their life cycle.

- 0) Copy everything you need into the Deployment Server directory
- 1) Remove existing container (Nginx or Tomcat)
+
image::images/ci/angular/container1.png[, link="container1.png"]
+

- 3) Add the artifact `/dist` to the "deployable" folder of the Docker container (`/usr/share/nginx/html/`)
+
image::images/ci/angular/container3.png[, link="container3.png"]

Now, let's see how it's being executed in the command line (simplified due to documentation purposes). The next block of code represents what is inside of the last stage of the Pipeline.

[source, groovy]</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>sshagent (credentials: ['my_ssh_token']) {
    sh """
        // Copy artifact from workspace to deployment server</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>        // Manage container:
        docker rm -f [mts-container]
        docker run -itd --name=[mts-container] [base_image]

        docker cp [artifact] [mts-container]:[container_deployment_folder]
    """
}</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>+
For every operation performed in the external Deployment Server, it is necessary to define _where_ those commands are going to be executed. So, for each one of previous `docker` commands, this should appear before:

    `ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no root@10.40.235.244`

[[deployment-strategies.asciidoc_docker-compose]]
== Docker Compose

The second way of deployment will be by orchestrating both elements of the application: The Angular client-side and the Java server-side. Both elements will be running in Docker containers as well, but in this case they won't be independent anymore. *Docker Compose* will be in charge of keeping both containers up, or to put them down.


[[deployment-strategies.asciidoc_project-adjustment]]
=== Project adjustment

In order to perform this second way of deployment, some files will be created in the project. The first one is the *Dockerfile* for the Angular client-side. This file will pull (if necessary) an *Nginx* Docker image and copy the Angular artifact (`/dist` folder) inside of the deployment folder of the image. It will be located in the main directory of the Angular client-side project.

image::images/ci/deployment/dockerfile-angular.PNG[, link="dockerfile-angular.PNG"]

The second file is the *Dockerfile* for the Java server-side. Its function will be quite similar to the Angular one. It will run a *tomcat* Docker image and copy the Java artifact (`mythaistar.war` file) in its deployment folder.

image::images/ci/deployment/dockerfile-java.PNG[, link="dockerfile-java.PNG"]

Finally, as long as the *docker-compose* is being used, a file containing its configuration will be necessary as well. A new folder one the main My That Star's directory is created, and it's called `/docker`. Inside there is just a `docker-compose.yml` file. It contains all the information needed to orchestrate the deployment process. For example, which port both containers are going to be published on, and so on. This way of deployment will allow the application to be published or not just with one action.

    docker-compose rm -f            # down
    docker-compose up --build -d    # up fresh containers


image::images/ci/deployment/docker-compose.PNG[, link="docker-compose.PNG"]

Let's have a look at the file itself:

[source, yaml]</pre>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>version: '3'

[[future-deployment.asciidoc]]
= Future Deployment

The *My Thai Star* project is going to be built in many technologies. Thus, let's think about one deployment schema that allow the Angular client to communicate to all three back ends: *Java*, *Node* and *.NET*.

As long as *Docker containers* are being used, it shouldn't be that hard to deal with this "distributed" deployment. The schema represents 6 Docker containers that will have client-side(s) and server-side(s). Each of 3 Angular client containers (those in red) are going to communicate with different back-ends. So, when the deployment is finished, it would be possible to use all three server-sides just by changing the "port" in the URL.

Let's see how it would look like:

[[traefik-reverse-proxy.asciidoc_reverse-proxy-strategy-using-traefik]]
== Reverse proxy strategy using Traefik

This implementation is the same as described at xref:deployment.asciidoc[My Thai Star deployment wiki page]. The only thing that changes is that Traefik is used instead of NGINX.

Using Traefik as reverse proxy, we can define the routes using labels in the docker containers instead of using a `nginx.conf` file. With this, it is not necessary to modify the reverse proxy container for each application. In addition, as Traefik is listening to the docker daemon, it can detect new containers and create routes for them without rebooting.

Example of labels:

[source,yaml]</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>labels:
    - "traefik.http.routers.angular.rule=PathPrefix(<code>/</code>)"
    - "traefik.http.services.angular.loadBalancer.healthcheck.path=/health"
    - "traefik.http.services.angular.loadBalancer.healthcheck.interval=10s"
    - "traefik.http.services.angular.loadBalancer.healthcheck.scheme=http"</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>[[traefik-reverse-proxy.asciidoc_how-to-use-it]]
=== How to use it

If you want to build the images from code, change to My Thai Star root folder and execute:

[source,bash]</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.traefik.yml up -d --build</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>If you want to build the images from artifacts, change to Traefik folder `(reverse-proxy/traefik)` and execute:

[source,bash]</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>$ docker-compose up -d --build</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>After a seconds, when the healthcheck detects that containers are running, your application will be available at http://localhost:8090. Also, the Traefik dashboard is available at http://localhost:8080.

If you want to check the behavior of the application when you scale up the back-end, you can execute:

[source,bash]</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>$ docker-compose scale java=5</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>With this, the access to the java back-end will be using the load balancing method: Weighted Round Robin.

[[nkaas.asciidoc]]
= `MyThaiStar` on Native Kubernetes as a Service (nKaaS)

The `MyThaiStar` sample application can be deployed on a nKaaS environment. The required Kubernetes configuration files can be found in the `MyThaiStar` repository. There are no additional changes required in order to deploy the application.

[[nkaas.asciidoc_setting-up-the-environment]]
== Setting up the environment

[[nkaas.asciidoc_following-the-nkaas-guide]]
=== Following the nKaaS guide

After requesting access to the nKaaS platform you'll be greeted with a welcome mail which contains your personal credentials. Make sure to change the given password to a personal one within the 24 hour time period, otherwise the  credentials will expire.

After successfully following the link:https://portal.capgemini-ips.com/native-kubernetes/getting-started[guide] mentioned in the welcome mail you should be able to establish a connection to the nKaaS VPN and have access to all their services (Jenkins, BitBucket, etc.). You should also be able to communicate with Kubernetes using kubectl.

*Known issues:* The nKaaS guide provides a download link for *OpenVPN Connect*. However, some users experienced connection issues with this client. If you're having issues connecting to the VPN with OpenVPN Connect, you may try out the client by link:https://www.ovpn.com/en/guides/windows-openvpn-gui[OVPN].

[[nkaas.asciidoc_requesting-a-namespace]]
=== Requesting a namespace

Initially, you won't be able to edit anything on Kubernetes, as you don't have any privileges on any namespace. To request your own namespace you should raise a ticket at the link:https://servicedesk.capgemini-ips.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/143[Customer Support Portal] containing your desired name for the namespace.

As soon as the namespace was created you can change your kubectl context:

[source]</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>kubectl config set-context --current -namespace=YOUR-NAMESPACE</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>On your own namespace you should have permissions to create/delete deployments/services etc. and perform other actions.

[[nkaas.asciidoc_setting-up-harbor]]
== Setting up Harbor

Jenkins will build the `MyThaiStar` Docker images and push them to the nKaaS link:http://harbor.demo.xpaas.io[Harbor registry]. The Jenkinsfile defaults to a Harbor project called "my-thai-star". If there's no such project on Harbor, simply create a new one.

[[nkaas.asciidoc_setting-up-jenkins]]
== Setting up Jenkins

As `MyThaiStar` includes all required Jenkinsfiles for nKaaS, almost no configurations have to be performed by the user.
Create a new Pipeline on link:http://jenkins.demo.xpaas.io[Jenkins] and configure its definition to be a "Pipeline script from SCM". The SCM used is "Git" and the repository URL is the `MyThaiStar` repository https://github.com/devonfw/my-thai-star.git or your fork of it.

The Branch Specifier should point to `*/develop`, the Script Path is `jenkins/nKaaS/Jenkinsfile` as that's where the Jenkinsfile is located at the `MyThaiStar` repository.
Checking the "Lightweight checkout" could speed up the Pipeline.

*Note:* If you're using the nKaaS link:http://bitbucket.demo.xpaas.io[Bitbucket] as repository for your `MyThaiStar` clone you have to perform some additional configurations. First you'll have to create a new SSH keypair, for example with `ssh-keygen`. Add the public key to the Bitbucket authentication methods and the private key in Jenkins to a new pair of credentials. This step is required for Jenkins to be able to authenticate against Bitbucket.
Afterwards, instead of the official `MyThaiStar` repository, specify your Bitbucket repository:

[source]</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ssh://git@bitbucket.demo.xpaas.io:7999/YOUR-PROJECT/YOUR-MTS-REPO.git</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Under "Credentials" choose the credentials that contain your Bitbucket private key you've created earlier.

[[nkaas.asciidoc_deploying-mts]]
== Deploying MTS

After setting up the Jenkins Pipeline, you can simply run it by clicking on the "Build" button. This will trigger the pipeline, Jenkins will:

1. Check out the MTS project
2. Build the docker images
3. Push the docker images to the Harbor registry
4. Deploy the MTS application onto Kubernetes

Finally, the applications should be available at http://my-thai-star.demo.xpaas.io.

The first part, `my-thai-star`, IST specified in the MTS link:https://github.com/devonfw/my-thai-star/blob/develop/jenkins/nKaaS/ingress.yaml[ingress] configuration at `host`. The second part, `demo.xpaas.io`, is the host of the nKaaS you're working on.

[[contributing.asciidoc_trivial-changes]]
=== Trivial Changes
Please note that for trivial changes like a typo in the documentation you do not need to follow a complex process. Please do the following:

* Just browse to the file online on GitHub.
* Click on the small pencil icon on the top right of the file content.
* Make the required changes.
* When editing documentation, verify your change by switching to the `Preview` tab at the top.
* When your change is complete, select `Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request` at the bottom.
* Comit your change by clicking the green `Propose file change` button at the bottom.
* Now fill summary and description and click on the green `Create pull request` button.
* That is all. Thank you very much! For details about pull requests read xref:CONTRIBUTING.asciidoc_pull-requests[here].

For non-trivial changes please read on.

[[contributing.asciidoc_issues]]
=== Issues
We are working issue-based, so check if there is already an issue in our tracker for the task you want to work on.
Otherwise first create a new issue for it (e.g. a bug report or a feature request).

If you want to contribute actively to resolve the issue (by providing code, documentation, etc.),
please assure via communication in that issue (comments, assigned user, etc.) that this is recognized and accepted by somebody from the community.
Especially in case of more complex issues, please get sure not to miss out such consensus with the community
and ensure that there is a common understanding of what and potentially even how to do it.
You surely do not want to invest your valuable work and time into something that will later be rejected by the community.
When you have been assigned to the issue (see `Assignees` on the right) you are sure that nobody else will work on the same issue in parallel and you are ready to go.

[[contributing.asciidoc_branches]]
=== Branches
Typically the latest development takes place on the `master` branch (in case there is a `develop` branch instead, use that one).
However, all changes are consequently done via feature-branches and pull-requests (see next sections).

[[contributing.asciidoc_forking]]
=== Forking
The github.com platform supports a wonderful feature to https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/[fork a repository].
Make use of this create your private copy where you experiment and prepare your contribution in an isolated environment:

* Visit the original repository you want to contribute to.
* Click on the `Fork` button at the top right. If asked for a destination choose your personal GitHub account.
* Clone this fork with a git-client to your local machine.
* Checkout the branch to use as baseline (see above section).
* From there create and checkout a new feature branch (named `feature/«issue-id»-«feature-keywords»`)
* Start your work on this new feature branch.

Sometimes, when working on your fork, there will be changes made to the original repository, which you might want to incorporate into your fork's master branch. To do this, you can https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork[sync your fork]:

* Add the remote URL of the original repo to your list of remotes: `git remote add upstream «remote-url»`
* Fetch the changes from the upstream remote: `git fetch upstream`
* Check out your fork's master branch: `git checkout master` (assuming you're working on a feature branch)
* Merge the changes from upstream/master into your fork's master branch: `git merge upstream/master`
* This brings your fork's master branch into sync with the original repository without losing changes on your local feature branch.
* Switch back to your feature branch to continue work: `git checkout «feature-branch»`

[[contributing.asciidoc_code-changes]]
=== Code Changes
Before you start with your code changes, please check the following conventions:

* For each programming language we have a stack repository (see xref:CONTRIBUTING.asciidoc_repositories[repositories]) containing documentation about the coding conventions (example: https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/develop/documentation/coding-conventions.asciidoc[Java]). Please read and follow these conventions before making (bigger) changes.
* Use https://github.com/devonfw/ide/blob/master/documentation/Home.asciidoc[devon-ide] to setup your development environment and get code formatters, etc. configured properly as we do not like "diff-wars" because of inconsistent formatter settings.
* Thank you, happy coding!

[[contributing.asciidoc_documentation-changes]]
=== Documentation Changes
Before you start with your documentation changes, please check the following conventions:

* Documentation will always be found in the `documentation` folder at the root of a repository.
* All our documentation is written in the http://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc] format.
* All documentation files need to carry the `.asciidoc` extension and should be named in `lower-train-case` style.
* Common prefixes help to categorize documentation files: `tutorial-` is used for step-by-step instructions, `guide-` is used for guidelines on a particular aspect, `coding-` is for specific conventions or details about source-code, `alternative-` is for less official options that are not recommended but to still offer knowledge for people using that option, `decision-` is for rationales why a complex (technology) decision was made.
* For automatic spellcheck we have integrated PySpelling in repositories. In case you have failure for spellcheck you can refer document  https://github.com/devonfw/.github/blob/master/SPELLCHECK_HELP.asciidoc[here]
* Please read and follow our https://github.com/devonfw/docgen/#guidelines[documentation guidelines].

[.internal]
contributing-internal-snippets

[[contributing.asciidoc_testing-changes]]
=== Testing Changes
To test your changes all you need to do is run the following command:
[source]
devon build

If the build failed, you need to rework your changes.

[[contributing.asciidoc_committing-changes]]
=== Committing Changes
Always commit your changes in small logical units associated with an issue (see above section) using the commit message format:
[source]
#«issue-id»: «describe your change»
Then GitHub will automatically link the commit with the issue.

Example:
[source]
#1: added REST service for tablemanagement

In case you worked on an issue from a different repository (e.g. change in `ide-settings` due to issue in `ide`), we use this commit message format:
[source]
«organization»/«repository»#«issue-id»: «describe your change»

Example:
[source]
devonfw/devon4j#1: added REST service for tablemanagement

[[contributing.asciidoc_pushing-changes]]
=== Pushing Changes
To make your changes public you need to push them.
If you are doing this for the first time since you started your feature branch, you also need to publish that branch (`git push -u origin feature/«issue-id»-«feature-keywords»`).
After that a `git push` is sufficient.

[[contributing.asciidoc_definition-of-done]]
=== Definition of Done
To complete your changes ensure the following aspects:

* You have tested your changes and the build succeeds.
* Code and documentation are in sync (if you coded new features you also extended documentation, etc.).
* You followed the coding conventions and documentation guidelines.
* For new features you have added automated unit tests.

Do not worry; we will assist you in case you are unsure or missed out on something.
However, you make your and our life easier, if you follow this Definition of Done (DoD) before providing your pull request.

[[contributing.asciidoc_pull-requests]]
=== Pull Requests
Once you have completed your changes and DoD, you can finally https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request[create] a https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests[pull request] (PR).

Please ensure the following aspects:

* When selecting a title for your pull request, follow the same conventions that apply to xref:CONTRIBUTING.asciidoc_committing-changes[commit messages].
* Also add the related issue(s) to the description of the pull request (e.g. `fixes #«issue-id»`).
* If you are providing a PR that is not yet ready for merging, please use GitHub's https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests[draft pull request] feature:
** Expand the drop-down menu of the green `Create Pull Request` button and select `Create Draft Pull Request`
** You can make further code changes to your PR by pushing commits to the corresponding feature branch.
** When you're ready to get feedback on your PR, click the `Ready for review` button.
* If you are providing a PR that is ready for merging, click on the green `Create Pull Request` button.

Your pull request will automatically be checked for these requirements:

* Can be merged without conflicts.
* Builds correctly (no compile or test errors).
* https://cla-assistant.io/devonfw/architectures[CLA] has been signed. If you contribute for the first time, you need to https://cla-assistant.io/devonfw/architectures[sign the CLA] once.

Please ensure to do the required tasks and reworks unless all checks are satisfied.
From here a reviewer should take over and give feedback.
In the best case, your contribution gets merged and everything is completed.
You might also get review feedback and requests for changes.
In that case walk through the review feedback and try to resolve it.
Once you push your new commits, the PR gets updated automatically and all checks will verify again.
Also GitHub will automatically make resolved review comments as outdated.
If you do not plan to put any further work into your PR before it is completed and merged, please let us know by writing an according comment.
We might find resources to get the PR done for you if it is already valuable.
In case you should not get feedback for weeks, do not hesitate to ask the community.

NOTE: If one (typically the reviewer) has to change the base branch (because the wrong develop branch was used, see above) onto which the changes will be merged, one can do the same by following the instructions at https://github.com/blog/2224-change-the-base-branch-of-a-pull-request/[here].

[[oss-compliance.asciidoc]]
= OSS Compliance

This chapter helps you to gain transparency on OSS usage and reach OSS compliance in your project.

[[oss-compliance.asciidoc_preface]]
== Preface

devonfw, as most Java software, makes strong use of Open Source Software (OSS). It is using about 150 OSS products on the server only and on the client even more. Using a platform like devonfw to develop your own custom solution requires handling contained OSS correctly, i.e acting _OSS-compliant_.

Please read the Open Source policy of your company first, e.g. the https://talent.capgemini.com/media_library/Medias/Common_images/OSS_Policy__Final.pdf[Capgemini OSS Policy] which contains a short, comprehensive and well written explanation on relevant OSS-knowledge. Make sure you:

* understand the copyleft effect and its effect in commercial projects
* understand the 3 license categories: "permissive", "weak copyleft" and "strong copyleft"
* know prominent license types as e.g. "Apache-2.0" or GPL-3.0" and what copyleft-category they are in
* are aware that some OSS offer dual/multi-licenses
* Understand that OSS libraries often come with sub-dependencies of other OSS carrying licenses themselves

To define sufficient OSS compliance measures, contact your IP officer or legal team as early as possible, especially if you develop software for clients.

[[oss-compliance.asciidoc_obligations-when-using-oss]]
== Obligations when using OSS

If you create a custom solution containing OSS, this in legal sense is a "derived" work. If you distribute your derived work to your business client or any other legal entity in binary packaged form, the license obligations of contained OSS get into effect. Ignoring these leads to a license infringement which can create high damage.

To carefully handle these obligations you must:

* maintain an OSS inventory (to gain transparency on OSS usage and used licenses)
* check license conformity depending on usage/distribution in a commercial scenario
* check license compatibility between used OSS-licenses
* fulfill obligations defined by the OSS-licenses

Obligations need to be checked per license. Frequent obligations are:

* deliver the license terms of all used versions of the OSS licenses
* not to change any copyright statements or warranty exclusions contained in the used OSS components
* deliver the source code of the OSS components (e.g. on a data carrier)
* when modifying OSS, track any source code modification (including date and name of the employee/company)
* display OSS license notice in a user frontend (if any)
* other obligations depending on individual license

[[oss-compliance.asciidoc_automate-oss-handling]]
== Automate OSS handling

Carefully judging the OSS usage in your project is a MANUAL activity! However, collecting OSS information and fulfilling license obligations should be automated as much as possible. A prominent professional tool to automate OSS compliance is the commercial software "Black Duck". Unfortunately it is rather expensive - either purchased or used as SaaS.

The most recommended lightweight tooling is a combination of Maven plugins. We will mainly use the http://www.mojohaus.org/license-maven-plugin/[Mojo Maven License Plugin].

[[oss-compliance.asciidoc_configure-the-mojo-maven-license-plugin]]
== Configure the Mojo Maven License Plugin

You can use it from command line but this will limit the ability to sustainably configure it (shown later).
Therefore we add it permanently as a build-plugin to the project parent-pom like this:

[source,xml]
--------
&lt;plugin&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.codehaus.mojo&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;license-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;1.14&lt;/version&gt;

  &lt;configuration&gt;
    &lt;outputDirectory&gt;${project.build.directory}/generated-resources&lt;/outputDirectory&gt;
    &lt;sortArtifactByName&gt;true&lt;/sortArtifactByName&gt;
    &lt;includeTransitiveDependencies&gt;true&lt;/includeTransitiveDependencies&gt;
    &lt;!-- the "missing file" declares licenses for dependencies that could not be detected automatically --&gt;
    &lt;useMissingFile&gt;true&lt;/useMissingFile&gt;
    &lt;!-- find the "missing files" in all child-projects at the following location --&gt;
    &lt;missingFile&gt;src/license/THIRD-PARTY.properties&lt;/missingFile&gt;
    &lt;!-- if the "missing files" are not yet existing in child-projects they will be created automatically --&gt;
    &lt;failOnMissing&gt;false&lt;/failOnMissing&gt;
    &lt;overrideFile&gt;src/license/override-THIRD-PARTY.properties&lt;/overrideFile&gt;
    &lt;!-- harmonize different ways of writing license names --&gt;
    &lt;licenseMerges&gt;
      &lt;licenseMerge&gt;Apache-2.0|Apache 2.0&lt;/licenseMerge&gt;
      &lt;licenseMerge&gt;Apache-2.0|Apache License, Version 2.0&lt;/licenseMerge&gt;
      &lt;licenseMerge&gt;Apache-2.0|Apache Software License, Version 2.0&lt;/licenseMerge&gt;
      &lt;licenseMerge&gt;Apache-2.0|The Apache Software License, Version 2.0&lt;/licenseMerge&gt;
    &lt;/licenseMerges&gt;
    &lt;encoding&gt;utf-8&lt;/encoding&gt;
  &lt;/configuration&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;
--------

In the config above there are several settings that help to permanently improve the result of an automated OSS scan. We explain these now.

[[oss-compliance.asciidoc_declare-additional-licenses]]
=== Declare additional licenses

Sometimes the licenses of used OSS cannot be resolved automatically. That is not the mistake of the maven-license-tool, but the mistake of the OSS author who didn't make the respective license-information properly available.

Declare additional licenses in a "missing file" within _each_ maven-subproject: /src/license/THIRD-PARTY.properties.

[source,xml]
--------
# Generated by org.codehaus.mojo.license.AddThirdPartyMojo
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Already used licenses in project :
# - ASF 2.0
# - Apache 2
...
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Please fill the missing licenses for dependencies :
...
dom4j--dom4j--1.6.1=BSD 3-Clause
javax.servlet--jstl--1.2=CDDL
...
--------

In case the use of "missing files" is activated, but the THIRD-PARTY.properties-file is not yet existing, the first run of an "aggregate-add-third-party" goal (see below) will fail. Luckily the license-plugin just helped us and created the properties-files automatically (in each maven-subproject) and prefilled it with:

* a list of all detected licenses within the maven project
* all OSS libraries where a license could not be detected automatically.

You now need to fill in missing license information and rerun the plugin.

[[oss-compliance.asciidoc_redefine-wrongly-detected-licenses]]
=== Redefine wrongly detected licenses

In case automatically detected licenses proof to be wrong by closer investigation, this wrong detection can be overwritten. Add a configuration to declare alternative licenses within each maven-subproject: /src/license/override-THIRD-PARTY.properties

[source,xml]
--------
com.sun.mail--javax.mail--1.5.6=Common Development and Distribution License 1.1
--------

This can be also be useful for OSS that provides a multi-license to make a decision which license to actually choose .

[[oss-compliance.asciidoc_merge-licenses]]
=== Merge licenses

You will see that many prominent licenses come in all sorts of notations, e.g. Apache-2.0 as: "Apache 2" or "ASL-2.0" or "The Apache License, Version 2.0". The Mojo Maven License Plugin allows to harmonize different forms of a license-naming like this:

[source,xml]
--------
    &lt;!-- harmonize different ways of writing license names --&gt;
    &lt;licenseMerges&gt;
      &lt;licenseMerge&gt;Apache-2.0|Apache 2.0&lt;/licenseMerge&gt;
      &lt;licenseMerge&gt;Apache-2.0|Apache License, Version 2.0&lt;/licenseMerge&gt;
      &lt;licenseMerge&gt;Apache-2.0|Apache Software License, Version 2.0&lt;/licenseMerge&gt;
      &lt;licenseMerge&gt;Apache-2.0|The Apache Software License, Version 2.0&lt;/licenseMerge&gt;
    &lt;/licenseMerges&gt;
--------

License-names will be harmonized in the OSS report to one common term. We propose to harmonize to short-license-IDs defined by the https://spdx.org/[SPDX] standard.

[[oss-compliance.asciidoc_retrieve-licenses-list]]
== Retrieve licenses list

For a quick initial judgement of OSS license situation run the following maven command from command line:

[source,bash]
--------
$ mvn license:license-list
--------

You receive the summary list of all used OSS licenses on the cmd-out.

[[oss-compliance.asciidoc_create-an-oss-inventory]]
== Create an OSS inventory

To create an OSS inventory means to report on the overall bill of material of used OSS and corresponding licenses.
Within the parent project, run the following maven goal from command line.

[source,bash]
--------
$ mvn license:aggregate-download-licenses -Dlicense.excludedScopes=test,provided
--------

Running the aggregate-download-licenses goal creates two results.

. a license.xml that contains all used OSS dependencies (even sub-dependencies) with respective license information
. puts all used OSS-license-texts as html files into folder target/generated resources

Carefully validate and judge the outcome of the license list. It is recommended to copy the license.xml to the project documentation and hand it over to your client. You may also import it into a spreadsheet to get a better overview.

[[oss-compliance.asciidoc_create-a-third-party-file]]
== Create a THIRD PARTY file

Within Java software it is a common practice to add a "THIRD-PARTY" text file to the distribution. Contained is a summary-list of all used OSS and respective licenses. This can also be achieved with the Mojo Maven License Plugin.

Within the parent project, run the following maven goal from command line.

[source,bash]
--------
$ mvn license:aggregate-add-third-party -Dlicense.excludedScopes=test,provided
--------

Find the THIRD-PARTY.txt in the folder: target\generated-resources. The goal aggregate-add-third-party also profits from configuration as outlined above.

[[oss-compliance.asciidoc_download-and-package-oss-sourcecode]]
== Download and package OSS SourceCode

Some OSS licenses require handing over the OSS source code which is packaged with your custom software to the client the solution is distributed to. It is a good practice to hand over the source code of _all_ used OSS to your client. Collecting all source code can be accomplished by another Maven plugin: Apache Maven Dependency Plugin.

It downloads all OSS Source Jars into the folder: \target\sources across the parent and all child maven projects.

You configure the plugin like this:

[source,xml]
--------
&lt;plugin&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-dependency-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;3.0.2&lt;/version&gt;

  &lt;configuration&gt;
    &lt;classifier&gt;sources&lt;/classifier&gt;
    &lt;failOnMissingClassifierArtifact&gt;false&lt;/failOnMissingClassifierArtifact&gt;
    &lt;outputDirectory&gt;${project.build.directory}/sources&lt;/outputDirectory&gt;
  &lt;/configuration&gt;
  &lt;executions&gt;
    &lt;execution&gt;
      &lt;id&gt;src-dependencies&lt;/id&gt;
      &lt;phase&gt;package&lt;/phase&gt;
      &lt;goals&gt;
        &lt;!-- use unpack-dependencies instead if you want to explode the sources --&gt;
        &lt;goal&gt;copy-dependencies&lt;/goal&gt;
      &lt;/goals&gt;
    &lt;/execution&gt;
  &lt;/executions&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;
--------

You run the plugin from command line like this:

[source,bash]
--------
$ mvn dependency:copy-dependencies -Dclassifier=sources
--------

The plugin provides another goal that also unzips the jars, which is not recommended, since contents get mixed up.

Deliver the OSS source jars to your client with the release of your custom solution. This has been done physically - e.g. on DVD.

[[oss-compliance.asciidoc_handle-oss-within-ci-process]]
== Handle OSS within CI-process

To automate OSS handling in the regular build-process (which is not recommended to start with) you may declare the following executions and goals in your maven-configuration:

[source,xml]
--------
&lt;plugin&gt;
  ...

  &lt;executions&gt;
    &lt;execution&gt;
      &lt;id&gt;aggregate-add-third-party&lt;/id&gt;
      &lt;phase&gt;generate-resources&lt;/phase&gt;
      &lt;goals&gt;
        &lt;goal&gt;aggregate-add-third-party&lt;/goal&gt;
      &lt;/goals&gt;
    &lt;/execution&gt;

    &lt;execution&gt;
      &lt;id&gt;aggregate-download-licenses&lt;/id&gt;
      &lt;phase&gt;generate-resources&lt;/phase&gt;
      &lt;goals&gt;
        &lt;goal&gt;aggregate-download-licenses&lt;/goal&gt;
      &lt;/goals&gt;
    &lt;/execution&gt;
  &lt;/executions&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;
--------

Note that the build may fail in case the OSS information was not complete. Check the build-output to understand and resolve the issue - like e.g. add missing license information in the "missing file".

== MrChecker

MrChecker Test Framework is an end to end test automation framework written in Java. It is an automated testing framework for functional testing of web applications, API web services, Service Virtualization, Security, native mobile apps and, in the near future, databases. All modules have tangible examples of how to build resilient integration test cases based on delivered functions. Two new modules are added to MrChecker:

* DB Module - we have created a module intended to make testing efforts on DBs easier. It is founded on JPA in conjunction with Hibernate and therefore supports both high level, object based access to DB entities via the IDao interface and low level, native SQL commands via the EntityManager class .

* CLI Module - we have created a module intended to make testing command line applications like compilers or batches easier and faster. Huge success here is that, team using this solution was able to prepare a test suite, without app provided, basing only on documentation and using mocking technique.

[[release-notes-version-3.2.asciidoc]]
= devonfw Release notes 3.2 “Homer”


[[release-notes-version-3.2.asciidoc_introduction]]
== Introduction

We are proud to announce the immediate release of devonfw version 3.2 (code named “Homer” during development). This version is the first one that contains the **new devonfw IDE** by default, so there is no need to download a huge ZIP with the whole distribution regardless of the use to which it will be put. The new devonfw IDE CLI will allow any user to setup a customized development environment completely configured with access to all the devonfw features, frameworks and tools. As we access to the official IDEs this is also the first version macOS compatible.

This release consolidates the documentation workflow adding the contents dynamically to the new devonfw website at the same time the PDF is generated. This have been achieved using a new GitHub action that takes the contents and builds the HTML files for the documentation section of the website. The documentation workflow proposed in the following picture is now complete:

image::images/documentation_workflow.png[link="images/documentation_workflow.png"]

This release also includes the **first version of devon4node**. We consider that node.js should be a first-class citizen inside the devonfw platform and for that reason we have included the latest development technologies for this ecosystem. The devon4node CLI, schematics and other tools will allow our users to create powerful node.js applications with the same philosophy you may find in the other languages and frameworks included. More information at its section below.

The new **devon4net 3.2.0 version** is also included in this release. Based on the .NET Core 3.0 and containing lots of new features gathered from important and recent projects, it represents a great improvement and an intermediate step to provide support for the incoming .NET Core 3.1 LTS. More information at its section below.

This release includes the final version of the **new CobiGen CLI** and completely integrated with the new devonfw IDE. Now using commands, you will be able to generate code the same way as you do with Eclipse. This means that you can use CobiGen on other IDEs like Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ. Besides the Update command has been implemented. Now you will be able to update easily all your CobiGen plug-ins and templates inside the CLI.

On the other hand, the refactoring process has been completely developed, improving the mergers and including input readers for any other languages and frameworks, allowing the creation of models to generate code from them. Last, but not least, this new version includes the new templates for devon4net, devon4ng and devon4j generation.

And as always, **My Thai Star** has been updated to the latest versions of devon4j, devon4node and devon4net including completely State Management with NgRx in its devon4ng implementation upgrade.

This is the last release with the current semantic versioning number and without a fixed release calendar. From now on the new devonfw releases will happen in April, August and December and will be named **YYYY.MM.NN**, being the first release of the next year the 2020.04.00.

== Changes and new features

[[release-notes-version-3.2.asciidoc_devonfw-ide]]
=== devonfw-ide

We have entirely rewritten our automated solution for your local IDE (integrated desktop environment). The former oasp4j-ide and devonfw distributions with their extra-large gigabyte zip files are not entirely replaced with devonfw-ide. This new solution is provided as a small *.tar.gz file that is publicly available. It works on all platforms and has been tested on Windows, MacOS, and Linux. After extraction you only need to run a `setup` script. Here you provide a settings git URL for your customer project or simply hit return for testing or small projects. After reading and confirming the terms of use it will download all required tools in the proper versions for your operating system and configure them. Instead of various confusing scripts there is now only one CLI command `devon` for all use-cases what gives a much better user experience.

To get started go to the https://github.com/devonfw/ide/blob/master/documentation/Home.asciidoc#devon-ide[home page]. There is even a https://github.com/devonfw/ide/blob/master/documentation/migration-from-devonfw-3.0.0-or-lower.asciidoc#migration-from-oasp4j-ide[migration-guide] if you are currently used to the old approach and want to quickly jump into the new solution.

*** Added a version provider so that you will be able to know all the CobiGen plug-ins versions.
*** Added a process bar when the CLI is downloading the CobiGen plug-ins.
** CobiGen refactoring finished: With this refactoring we have been able to decouple CobiGen completely from the target and input language. This facilitates the creation of parsers and mergers for any language. For more information please take a look https://github.com/devonfw/cobigen/wiki/howto_create-external-plugin[here].
*** New TypeScript input reader: We are now able to parse any TypeScript class and generate code using the parsed information. We currently use https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/blob/master/docs/entities.md#what-is-entity[TypeORM] entities as a base for generation.
** Improving CobiGen templates:
*** Updated devon4ng-NgRx templates to NgRx 8.
*** Generation of an Angular client using as input a https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/blob/master/docs/entities.md#what-is-entity[TypeORM] entity. This is possible thanks to the new TypeScript input reader.
*** .Net templates have been upgraded to .Net Core 3.0
** CobiGen for Eclipse is now JDK11 compatible.
** Fixed bugs when adapting templates and other bugs on the CobiGen core.

= devonfw Release notes 3.1 “Goku”


[[release-notes-version-3.1.asciidoc_introduction]]
== Introduction

We are proud to announce the immediate release of devonfw version 3.1 (code named “Goku” during development). This version is the first one that implements our new documentation workflow, that will allow users to get the updated documentation at any moment and not to wait for the next devonfw release.

This is now possible as we have established a new workflow and rules during development of our assets. The idea behind this is that all the repositories contain a `documentation` folder and, in any pull request, the developer must include the related documentation change. A new Travis CI configuration added to all these repositories will automatically take the changes and publish them in the wiki section of every repository and in the new devonfw-guide repository that consolidates all the changes from all the repositories. Another pipeline will take changes from this consolidated repository and generate dynamically the devonfw guide in PDF and in the next weeks in HTML for the new planned devonfw website. The following schema explains this process:

image::images/documentation_workflow.png[link="images/documentation_workflow.png"]

This release includes the very first version of the new CobiGen CLI. Now using commands, you will be able to generate code the same way as you do with Eclipse. This means that you can use CobiGen on other IDEs like Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ. Please take a look at https://github.com/devonfw/cobigen/wiki/howto_Cobigen-CLI-generation for more info.

The devonfw-shop-floor project has got a lot of updates in order to make even easier the creation of devonfw projects with CICD pipelines that run on the Production Line, deploy on Red Hat OpenShift Clusters and in general Docker environments. See the details below.

This release includes the very first version of our devonfw-ide tool that will allow users to automate devonfw setup and update the development environment. This tool will become the default devonfw setup tool in future releases. For more information please visit the repository https://github.com/devonfw/devon-ide.

Following the same collaboration model we used in order to improve the integration of devonfw with Red Hat OpenShift and which allowed us to get the Red Hat Open Shift Primed certification, we have been working alongside with SAP HANA developers in order to support this database in the devon4j. This model was based on the contribution and review of pull requests in our reference application My Thai Star. In this case, SAP developers collaborated with us in the following two new use cases:

* Prediction of future demand
* Geospatial analysis and clustering of customers

More info at https://blogs.sap.com/2019/06/17/introducing-devonfw-support-for-sap-hana/.

Last but not least the devonfw extension pack for VS Code has been improved with the latest extensions and helpers for this IDE. Among many others you can now use:

* Remote development on Docker containers and VMs https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack
* Dependency Analysis for maven and npm https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.fabric8-analytics
* React Native Tools https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.vscode-react-native
* NgRx Snippets https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/itemdetails?itemName=hardikpthv.NgRxSnippets

Also it is worth the try of the updated support for Java and Spring Boot development in VS Code. Check it out for yourself!

[[release-notes-version-3.0.asciidoc]]
= devonfw Release notes 3.0 “Fry”

[[release-notes-version-3.0.asciidoc_introduction]]
== Introduction

We are proud to announce the immediate release of devonfw version 3.0 (code named “Fry” during development). This version is the consolidation of Open Source, focused on the major namespace change ever in the platform, removing the OASP references and adopting the new devonfw names for each technical stack or framework.

The new stack names are the following:

* devon4j, former devon4j, is the new name for Java.
* devon4ng, former devon4ng, is the new one for Angular.
* devon4net, is the new .NET stack.
* devon4X, is the new stack for Xamarin development.
* devon4node, is the new devonfw incubator for node.js.

The new devon4j version was created directly from the latest devon4j version (3.0.0). Hence it brings all the features and values that devon4j offered. However, the namespace migration was used to do some housekeeping and remove deprecated code as well as reduce dependencies. Therefore your data-access layer will no longer have to depend on any third party except for devon4j as well as of course the JPA. We also have improved the application template that now comes with a modern JSON logging ready for docker and logstash based environments.

To help you upgrading we introduced a migration feature in devcon. This can automatically migrate your code from devon4j (even older versions starting from 2.4.0) to the latest version of devon4j. There might be some small manual changes left to do but 90% of the migration will be done automatically for you.

Besides, the first version of the devonfw plugin for SonarQube has been released. It extends SonarQube with the ability to validate your code according to the devon4j architecture. More details at https://github.com/devonfw/sonar-devon-plugin.

This is the first release that integrates the new devonfw .NET framework, called devon4net, and Xamarin for mobile native development, devon4X. devon4NET and devon4X are the Capgemini standard frameworks for .NET and Xamarin software development. With the two new family members devonfw provides guidance and acceleration for the major software development platforms in our industry. Their interoperability provides you the assurance your multichannel solution will be consistent across web and mobile channels.

“Fry” release contains lots of improvements in our Mr.Checker E2E Testing Framework, including a complete E2E sample inside our reference application My Thai Star. Besides Mr.Checker, we include as an incubator Testar, a test tool (and framework)  to test applications at the GUI level whose objective is to solve part of the maintenance problem affecting tests by automatically generating test cases based on a structure that is automatically derived from the GUI. Testar is not included to replace Mr.Checker but rather to provide development teams with a series of interesting options which go beyond what Mr.Checker already provides.

Apart from Mr.Checker, engagements can now use Testar as an extra option for testing. This is a tool that enables the automated system testing of desktop, web and mobile applications at the GUI level. Testar has been added as an incubator to the platform awaiting further development during 2019.

The new incubator for node.js, called devon4node, has been included and implemented in several internal projects. This incubator is based on the Nest framework https://www.nestjs.com/. Nest is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications. It uses progressive JavaScript, is built with TypeScript (preserves compatibility with pure JavaScript) and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming). Under the hood, Nest makes use of Express, but also provides compatibility with a wide range of other libraries (e.g. Fastify). This allows for easy use of the myriad third-party plugins which are available.

In order to facilitate the utilization of Microsoft Visual Studio Code in devonfw, we have developed and included the new devonfw Platform Extension Pack with lots of features to develop and test applications with this IDE in languages and frameworks such as TypeScript, JavaScript, .NET, Java, Rust, C++ and many more. More information at https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=devonfw.devonfw-extension-pack. Also, you can contribute to this extension in this GitHub repository https://github.com/devonfw/devonfw-extension-pack-vscode.

There is a whole range of new features and improvements which can be seen in that light. The My Thai Star sample app has now been upgraded to devon4j and devon4ng, a new devon4node backend implementation has been included that is seamless interchangeable, an E2E MrChecker sample project, CICD and deployment scripts and lots of bugs have been fixed.

Last but not least, the projects wikis and the devonfw Guide has once again been updated accordingly before the big refactor that will be addressed in the following release in 2019.

[[release-notes-version-3.0.asciidoc_testar]]
==== Testar

We have added Test*, Testar, as an incubator to the available test tools within devonfw. This ground-breaking tool is being developed by the Technical University of Valencia (UPV). In 2019 Capgemini will co-develop Testar with the UPV.

Testar is a tool that enables the automated system testing of desktop, web and mobile applications at the GUI level.

With Testar, you can start testing immediately. It automatically generates and executes test sequences based on a structure that is automatically derived from the UI through the accessibility API. Testar can detect the violation of general-purpose system requirements and you can use plugins to customize your tests.

You do not need test scripts and maintenance of it. The tests are random and are generated and executed automatically.

If you need to do directed tests you can create scripts to test specific requirements of your application.

Testar is included in the devonfw distro or can be downloaded from https://testar.org/download/.

The Github repository can be found at o: https://github.com/TESTARtool/TESTAR.

[[release-notes-version-2.4.asciidoc]]
= devonfw Release notes 2.4 “EVE”

[[release-notes-version-2.4.asciidoc_introduction]]
== Introduction

We are proud to announce the immediate release of devonfw version 2.4 (code named “EVE” during development). This version is the first one that fully embraces Open Source, including components like the documentation assets and CobiGen. Most of the IP (Intellectual Property or proprietary) part of devonfw are now published under the Apache License version 2.0 (with the documentation under the Creative Commons License (Attribution-NoDerivatives)). This includes the GitHub repositories where all the code and documentation is located. All of these repositories are now open for public viewing as well.

“EVE” contains a slew of new features but in essence it is already driven by what we expect to be the core focus of 2018: strengthening the platform and improving quality.

This release is also fully focused on deepening the platform rather than expanding it. That is to say: we have worked on improving existing features rather than adding new ones and strengthen the qualitative aspects of the software development life cycle, i.e. security, testing, infrastructure (CI, provisioning) etc.

“EVE” already is very much an example of this. This release contains the Allure Test Framework (included as an incubator in version 2.3) update called MrChecker Test Framework. MrChecker is an automated testing framework for functional testing of web applications, API web services, Service Virtualization, Security and in coming future native mobile apps, and databases. All modules have tangible examples of how to build resilient integration test cases based on delivered functions.

Another incubator being updated is the devonfw Shop Floor which intended to be a compilation of DevOps experiences from the devonfw perspective. A new part of the release is the new Solution Guide for Application Security based on the state of the art in OWASP based application security.

There is a whole range of new features and improvements which can be seen in that light. devon4j 2.6 changes and improves the package structure of the core Java framework. The My Thai Star sample app has now been upgraded to Angular 6, lots of bugs have been fixed and the devonfw Guide has once again been improved.

Last but not least, this release contains the formal publication of the devonfw Methodology or The Accelerated Solution Design - an Industry Standards based solution design and specification (documentation) methodology for Agile (and less-than-agile) projects.

== Changes and new features

[[release-notes-version-2.4.asciidoc_devonfw-2.4-is-open-source]]
=== devonfw 2.4 is Open Source

This version is the first release of devonfw that fully embraces Open Source, including components like the documentation assets and CobiGen. This is done in response to intensive market pressure and demands from the MU´s (Public Sector France, Netherlands)

Most of the IP (Intellectual Property or proprietary) part of devonfw are now published under the Apache License version 2.0 (with the documentation under the Creative Commons License (Attribution-NoDerivatives)).

So you can now use the devonfw distribution (the "zip" file), CobiGen, the devonfw modules and all other components without any worry to expose the client unwittingly to Capgemini IP.

*Note:* there are still some components which are IP and are not published under an OSS license. The class room trainings, the Sencha components and some CobiGen templates. But these are not includes in the distribution nor documentation and are now completely maintained separately.

[[release-notes-version-2.4.asciidoc_devonfw-methodology-accelerated-solution-design]]
=== devonfw methodology: Accelerated Solution Design

One of the prime challenges in Distributed Agile Delivery is the maintenance of a common understanding and unity of intent among all participants in the process of creating a product. That is: how can you guarantee that different parties in the client, different providers, all in different locations and time zones during a particular period of time actually understand the requirements of the client, the proposed solution space and the state of implementation.

We offer the Accelerated Solution Design as a possible answer to these challenges. The ASD is carefully designed to be a practical guideline that fosters and ensures the collaboration and communication among all team members.

The Accelerated Solution Design is:

* A practical guideline rather than a “methodology”
* Based on industry standards rather than proprietary methods
* Consisting of an evolving, “living”, document set rather than a static, fixed document
* Encapsulating the business requirements, functional definitions as well as Architecture design
* Based on the intersection of Lean, Agile, DDD and User Story Mapping

And further it is based on the essential belief or paradigm that ASD should be:

* Focused on the design (definition) of the “externally observable behavior of a system”
* Promoting communication and collaboration between team members
* Guided by prototypes

For more on the devonfw Methodology / ASD, see:

[[release-notes-version-2.3.asciidoc]]
= devonfw Release notes 2.3 "Dash"

[[release-notes-version-2.3.asciidoc_release-improving-and-strengthening-the-platform]]
== Release: improving and strengthening the Platform

We are proud to announce the immediate release of *devonfw version 2.3* (code named “_Dash_” during development).  This release comes with a bit of a delay as we decided to wait for the publication of devon4j 2.5. “Dash” contains a slew of new features but in essence it is already driven by what we expect to be the core focus of 2018: strengthening the platform and improving quality.

After one year and a half of rapid expansion, we expect the next release(s) of the devonfw 2.x series to be fully focused on deepening the platform rather than expanding it. That is to say: we should work on improving existing features rather than adding new ones and strengthen the qualitative aspects of the software development life cycle, i.e. testing, infrastructure (CI, provisioning) etc.

“Dash” already is very much an example of this. This release contains the Allure Test Framework as an incubator. This is an automated testing framework for functional testing of web applications. Another incubator is the devonfw Shop Floor which intended to be a compilation of DevOps experiences from the devonfw perspective. And based on this devonfw has been _OpenShift Primed_ (“certified”) by Red Hat.

There is a whole range of new features and improvements which can be seen in that light. devon4j 2.5 changes and improves the package structure of the core Java framework. The My Thai Star sample app has now been fully integrated in the different frameworks and the devonfw Guide has once again been significantly expanded and improved.

[[release-notes-version-2.3.asciidoc_an-industrialized-platform-for-the-adcenter]]
== An industrialized platform for the ADcenter

Although less visible to the overall devonfw community, an important driving force was (meaning that lots of work has been done in the context of) the creation of the ADcenter concept towards the end of 2017. Based on a radical transformation of on/near/offshore software delivery, the focus of the ADcenters is to deliver agile &amp; accelerated “Rightshore” services with an emphasis on:

* Delivering Business Value and optimized User Experience
* Innovative software development with state of the art technology
* Highly automated devops; resulting in lower costs &amp; shorter time-to-market

The first two ADcenters, in Valencia (Spain) and Bangalore (India), are already servicing clients all over Europe - Germany, France, Switzerland  and the Netherlands - while ADcenter aligned production teams are currently working for Capgemini UK as well (through Spain).Through the ADcenter, Capgemini establishes industrialized innovation; designed for &amp; with the user. The availability of platforms for industrialized software delivery like devonfw and the Production Line has allowed us to train and make available over a 150 people in very short time.

The creation of the ADcenter is such a short time is visible proof that we´re getting closer to a situation where devonfw and Production Line are turning into the default development platform for APPS2, thereby standardizing all aspects of the software development life cycle: from training and design, architecture, devops and development,  all the way up to QA and deployment.

[[release-notes-version-2.3.asciidoc_devon4j-2.5]]
=== devon4j 2.5

[[release-notes-version-2.3.asciidoc_support-for-jax-rs--jax-ws-clients]]
==== Support for JAX-RS &amp; JAX-WS clients

With the aim to enhance the ease in consuming RESTful and SOAP web services, JAX-RS and JAX-WS clients have been introduced. They enable developers to concisely and efficiently implement portable client-side solutions that leverage existing and well-established client-side HTTP connector implementations. Furthermore, the getting started time for consuming web services has been considerably reduced with the default configuration out-of-the-box which can be tweaked as per individual project requirements.

See: https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/issues/358

[[release-notes-version-2.3.asciidoc_separate-security-logs-for-devon4j-log-component]]
==== Separate security logs for devon4j log component

Based on OWASP(Open Web Application Security Project), devon4j aims to give developers more control and flexibility with the logging of security events and tracking of forensic information. Furthermore, it helps classifying the information in log messages and applying masking when necessary. It provides powerful security features while based on set of logging APIs developers are already familiar with over a decade of their experience with Log4J and its successors.

[[release-notes-version-2.3.asciidoc_support-for-microservices]]
==== Support for Microservices

Integration of an devon4j application to a Microservices environment can now be leveraged with this release of devon4j. Introduction of service clients for RESTful and SOAP web services based on Java EE give developers agility and ease to access microservices in the Devon framework. It significantly cuts down the efforts on part of developers around boilerplate code and stresses more focus on the business code improving overall efficiency and quality of deliverables.

[[release-notes-version-2.3.asciidoc_cobigen]]
=== Cobigen

A new version of Cobigen has been included. New features include:

* Swagger/Yaml Plugin for CobiGen. CobiGen is able to read a swagger definition file that follows the OpenAPI 3.0 spec and generate code. A preliminary release was already included in 2.2.1 but the current version is much more mature and stable. See: https://github.com/devonfw/cobigen/wiki/howto_openapi_generation
* Integration of CobiGen into Maven build process. This already existed but has been improved. It consists mainly of documentation + better log output and bug fixes. See: https://github.com/devonfw/cobigen/wiki/cobigen-maven_configuration
* CobiGen Ionic CRUD App generation based on https://github.com/devonfw/devon4ng-ionic-application-template
* Cobigen_Templates project and docs updated
* Bugfixes and Hardening

[[release-notes-version-2.3.asciidoc_my-thai-star-sample-application]]
=== My Thai Star Sample Application

From this release on the My Thai Star application has been fully integrated in the different frameworks in the platform. Further more, a more modularized approach has been followed in the current release of My Thai star application to decouple client from implementation details. Which provides better encapsulation of code and dependency management for API and implementation classes. This has been achieved with creation of a new “API” module that contain interfaces for REST services and corresponding Request/Response objects. With existing “Core” module being dependent on “API” module. To read further you can follow the link https://github.com/devonfw/my-thai-star/wiki/java-design#basic-architecture-details

Furthermore: an email and Twitter micro service were integrated in my-thai-star. This is just for demonstration purposes. A full micro service framework is already part of devon4j 2.5.0

[[release-notes-version-2.3.asciidoc_harvested-components-and-modules]]
=== Harvested components and modules

The devonfw Harvesting process continues to add valuable components and modules to the devonfw platform. The last months the following elements were contributed:

[[release-notes-version-2.3.asciidoc_service-client-support-for-micro-service-projects.]]
==== Service Client support (for Micro service Projects).

This client is for consuming microservices from other application.This solution is already very flexible and customizable.As of now,this is suitable for small and simple project where two or three microservices are invoked. Donated by Jörg Hohwiller. See: https://github.com/devonfw-forge/devonfw-microservices

[[release-notes-version-2.3.asciidoc_jhipster-devonfw-code-generation]]
==== JHipster devonfw code generation

This component was donated by the ADcenter in Valencia. It was made in order to comply with strong requirements (especially from the French BU) to use jHipster for code generation.

JHipster is a code generator based on Yeoman generators. Its default generator generator-jhipster generates a specific JHipster structure. The purpose of generator-jhipster-DevonModule is to generate the structure and files of a typical devon4j project. It is therefore equivalent to the standard devon4j application template based CobiGen code generation.

[[release-notes-version-2.3.asciidoc_simple-jenkins-task-status-dashboard]]
==== Simple Jenkins task status dashboard

This component has been donated by, has been harvested from system in use by, Capgemini  Valencia. This dashboard, apart from an optional gamification element, allows the display of multiple Jenkins instances.

[[release-notes-version-2.2.asciidoc_mythaistar-new-restaurant-example,-reference-implementation--methodology-showcase]]
== MyThaiStar: New Restaurant Example, reference implementation &amp; Methodology showcase

A major part of the new devonfw release is the incorporation of a new application, "my-thai-star" which among others:

- serve as an example of how to make a "real" devonfw application (i.e. the application could be used for real)

- Serves  as an attractive showcase

- Serves as a reference application of devonfw patterns and practices as well as the standard example in the new devonfw tutorial

- highlights modern security option like JWT Integration

The application is  accompanied by a substantial new documentation asset, the devonfw methodology, which described in detail the whole lifecycle of the development of a devonfw application, from requirements gathering to technical design. Officially my-that-star is still considered to be an incubator as especially this last part is still not as mature as it could be. But the example application and tutorial are 100% complete and functional and form a marked improvement over the "old" restaurant example app. My-Thai-star will become the standard example app from devonfw 3.0 onwards.

See:     https://github.com/devonfw/my-thai-star
         https://github.com/devonfw/my-thai-star/wiki


[[release-notes-version-2.2.asciidoc_the-new-devonfw-tutorial]]
== The new devonfw Tutorial
The devonfw Tutorial is a new part of the devonfw documentation which changes the focus of how people can get started with the platform

There are tutorials for devon4j, devon4ng (Angular) and more to come. My-Thai-Star is used throughout the tutorial series to demonstrate the basic principles, architecture, and good practices of the different devonfw "stacks". There is an elaborated exercise where the readers get to write their own application "JumpTheQueue".


We hope that the new tutorial offers a better, more efficient way for people to get started with devonfw. Answering especially the question: how to make a devonfw application.

[[release-notes-version-2.2.asciidoc_microservices-netflix]]
== Microservices Netflix
devonfw now includes a microservices implementation based on Spring Cloud Netflix. It provides a Netflix OSS integrations for Spring Boot apps through auto-configuration and binding to the Spring Environment. It  offers microservices archetypes and a complete user guide with all the details to start creating microservices with devonfw.

See: https://github.com/devonfw-forge/devonfw-microservices

[[release-notes-version-2.2.asciidoc_devonfw-distribution-based-on-eclipse-oomph]]
== devonfw distribution based on Eclipse OOMPH
The new Eclipse devonfw distribution is now based on Eclipse OOMPH, which allows us, an any engagement, to create and manage the distribution more effectively by formalizing the setup instructions so they can be performed automatically (due to a blocking issue postponed to devonfw 2.2.1 which will be released a few weeks after 2.2.0)

[[release-notes-version-2.2.asciidoc_visual-studio-code-or-atom]]
== Visual Studio Code or Atom
The devonfw distro now contains Visual Studio Code alongside Eclipse in order to provide a default, state of the art, environment for web based development.

See: https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/cli.asciidoc.html#vscode.asciidoc

[[release-notes-version-2.2.asciidoc_more-i18n-options]]
== More I18N options
The platform now contains more documentation and a conversion utility which makes it easier to share i18n resource files between the different frameworks.

See: https://github.com/devonfw/devon/wiki/cookbook-i18n-resource-converter

[[release-notes-version-2.2.asciidoc_spring-integration-as-devonfw-module]]
== Spring Integration as devonfw Module
This release includes a new module based on the Java Message Service (JMS) and Spring Integration which provides a communication system (sender/subscriber) out-of-the-box with simple channels (only to send and read messages), request and reply channels (to send messages and responses) and request &amp; reply asynchronously channels.

See: https://github.com/devonfw/devon/wiki/cookbook-integration-module

[[release-notes-version-2.2.asciidoc_devonfw-harvest-contributions]]
== devonfw Harvest contributions
devonfw contains a whole series of new components obtained through the Harvesting process. Examples are :

* New backend IP module Compose for Redis: management component for cloud environments. Redis is an open-source, blazingly fast, key/value low maintenance store. Compose's platform gives you a configuration pre-tuned for high availability and locked down with additional security features. The component will manage the service connection and the main methods to manage the key/values on the storage. The library used is "lettuce".

* Sencha component for extending GMapPanel with the following functionality :
** Markers management
** Google Maps options management
** Geoposition management
** Search address and coordinates management
** Map events management
** Map life cycle and behavior management

* Sencha responsive Footer that moves from horizontal to vertical layout depending on the screen resolution or the device type. It is a simple functionality but we consider it very useful and reusable.

See: https://github.com/devonfw/devon/wiki/cookbook-compose-for-redis-module

[[release-notes-version-2.2.asciidoc_more-deployment-options-to-jee-application-servers-and-dockercloudfoundry]]
== More Deployment options to JEE Application Servers and Docker/CloudFoundry

The platform now fully supports deployment on the latest version of Weblogic, WebSphere, Wildfly (JBoss) as well as Docker and Cloud Foundry.

See:    https://github.com/devonfw/devon/wiki/Deployment-on-WebLogic
    https://github.com/devonfw/devon/wiki/cookbook-Deployment-on-WebSphere
    https://github.com/devonfw/devon/wiki/cookbook-Deployment-on-Wildfly

[[release-notes-version-2.2.asciidoc_devcon-on-linux]]
== Devcon on Linux
Devcon is now fully supported on Linux which, together with the devonfw distro running on Linux, makes devonfw fully multi-platform and Cloud compatible (as Linux is the default OS in the Cloud!)

See: https://github.com/devonfw/devcon/releases

[[release-notes-version-2.2.asciidoc_new-devonfw-incubators]]
== New devonfw Incubators
From different Business Units (countries) have contributed "incubator" frameworks:

- devon4NET (Stack based on .NET Core / .NET "Classic" (4.6))
- devon4X (Stack based on Xamarin)
- devon4node (Stack based on Node-js/Serverless): https://github.com/devonfw/devon4node

An "incubator" status means that the frameworks are production ready, all are actually already used in production, but  are still not fully compliant with the devonfw definition of a "Minimally Viable Product".

During this summer devon4NET will be properly installed. In the mean time, if you want to have access to the source code, please contact the _devonfw Core Team_.

[[release-notes-version-2.1.asciidoc_version-2.1.2-devon4j-updates-and-some-new-features]]
== Version 2.1.2: devon4j updates and some new features

We've released the latest update release of devonfw in the _Balu_ series: version 2.1.2. The next major release, code named _Courage_, will be released approximately the end of June. This current release contains the following items:

[[release-notes-version-2.1.asciidoc_devon4j-2.3.0-release]]
=== devon4j 2.3.0 Release

Friday the 12th of May 2017 devon4j version 2.3.0 was released. Major features added are :

- Database Integration with PostGres, MSSQL Server, MariaDB
- Added docs folder for gh pages and added oomph setups
- Refactored Code
- Refactored Test Infrastructure
- Added Documentation on debugging tests
- Added Two Batch Job tests in the restaurant sample
- Bugfix: Fixed the error received when the Spring Boot Application from sample application that is created from maven archetype is launched
- Bugfix: Fix for 404 error received when clicked on the link '1. Table' in index.html of the sample application created from maven archetype

The devon4j wiki and other documents are updated for release 2.3.0.

[[release-notes-version-2.1.asciidoc_cobigen-enhancements]]
=== CobiGen Enhancements

Previous versions of CobiGen are able to generate code for REST services only. Now it is possible to generate the code for SOAP services as well. There are two use cases available in CobiGen:

 - SOAP without nested data
 - SOAP nested data

The "nested data" use case is when there are 3 or more entities which are interrelated with each other. CobiGen will generate code which will return the nested data. Currently CobiGen services return ETO classes, CobiGen has been enhanced as to return CTO classes (ETO + relationship).

Apart from the SOAP code generation, the capability to express nested relationships have been added to the existing ReST code generator as well.

[[release-notes-version-2.1.asciidoc_micro-services-module-spring-cloudnetflix-oss]]
=== Micro services module (Spring Cloud/Netflix OSS)

To make it easier for devonfw users to design and develop applications based on microservices, this release provides a series of archetypes and resources based on _Spring Cloud Netflix_ to automate the creation and configuration of microservices.

New documentation ind de devonfw Guide contains all the details to start https://github.com/devonfw-forge/devonfw-microservices[creating microservices with devonfw]

[[release-notes-version-2.1.asciidoc_spring-integration-module]]
=== Spring Integration Module

Based on the _Java Message Service_ (JMS) and _Spring Integration_, the devonfw _Integration module_ provides a communication system (sender/subscriber) out-of-the-box with simple channels (only to send and read messages), request and reply channels (to send messages and responses) and request &amp; reply asynchronously channels.

[[release-notes-version-2.1.asciidoc_version-2.1.1-updates,-fixes-and-some-new-features]]
== Version 2.1.1 Updates, fixes and some new features

[[release-notes-version-2.1.asciidoc_cobigen-code-generator-fixes]]
=== CobiGen code-generator fixes

The CobiGen incremental code generator released in the previous version contained a regression which has now been fixed. Generating services in Batch mode whereby a package can be given as an input, using all Entities contained in that package, works again as expected.

For more information see: https://github.com/devonfw/cobigen/wiki[The CobiGen documentation]

[[general_release-notes-version-2.1.asciidoc_devcon-enhancements]]
=== Devcon enhancements

In this new release we have added devcon to the devonfw distribution itself so one can directly use devcon from the console.bat or ps-console.bat windows. It is therefore no longer necessary to independently install devcon. However, as devcon is useful outside of the devonfw distribution, this remains a viable option.

[[general_release-notes-version-2.1.asciidoc_devon4sencha]]
=== Devon4Sencha

in Devon4Sencha there are changes in the sample application. It now complies fully with the architecture which is known as "universal app", so now it has screens custom tailored for desktop and mobile devices. All the basic logic remains the same for both versions. (The StarterTemplate is still only for creating a desktop app. This will be tackled in the next release.)

[[release-notes-version-2.1.asciidoc_new-winauth-modules]]
=== New Winauth modules

The original _winauth_ module that, in previous Devon versions, implemented the _Active Directory_ authentication and the _Single Sign-on_ authentication now has been divided in two independent modules. The _Active Directory_ authentication now is included in the new _Winauth-ad_ module whereas the _Single Sign-on_ implementation is included in a separate module called _Winauth-sso_.
Also some improvements have been added to _Winauth-sso_ module to ease the way in which the module can be injected.

[[release-notes-version-2.1.asciidoc_general-updates]]
=== General updates

There are a series of updates to the devonfw documentation, principally the devonfw Guide. Further more, from this release on, you can find the devonfw guide in the _doc_ folder of the distribution.

Furthermore, the devon4j and devonfw source-code in the "examples" workspace, have been updated to the latest version.

[[release-notes-version-2.1.asciidoc_version-2.1-new-features,-improvements-and-updates]]
== Version 2.1 New features, improvements and updates

[[release-notes-version-2.1.asciidoc_introduction]]
=== Introduction

We are proud to present the new release of devonfw, version "2.1" which we've baptized "Balu". A major focus for this release is developer productivity. So that explains the name, as Balu is not just big, friendly and cuddly but also was very happy to let Mowgli do the work for him.

[[release-notes-version-2.1.asciidoc_cobigen-code-generator-ui-code-generation-and-more]]
=== Cobigen code-generator UI code generation and more

The Cobigen incremental code generator which is part of devonfw has been significantly improved. Based on a single data schema it can generate the JPA/Hibernate code for the whole service layer (from data-access code to web services) for all CRUD operations. When generating code, Cobigen is able to detect and leave untouched any code which developers have added manually.

In the new release it supports Spring Data for data access and it is now capable of generating the whole User Interface as well: data-grids and individual rows/records with support for filters, pagination etc.  That is to say: Cobigen can now generate automatically all the code from the server-side database access layer all the way up to the UI "screens" in the web browser.

Currently we support Sencha Ext JS with support for Angular 2 coming soon. The code generated by Cobigen can be opened and used by Sencha Architect, the visual design tool, which enables the programmer to extend and enhance the generated UI non-programmatically. When Cobigen regenerates the code, even those additions are left intact. All these features combined allow for an iterative, incremental way of development which can be up to an order of an magnitude more productive than "programming manual"

Cobigen can now also be used for code-generation within the context of an engagement. It is easily extensible and the process of how to extend it for your own project is well documented. This becomes already worthwhile ("delivers ROI") when having 5+ identical elements within the project.

For more information see: https://github.com/devonfw/cobigen/wiki[The Cobigen documentation]

[[release-notes-version-2.1.asciidoc_angular-2]]
=== Angular 2

With the official release of Angular 2 and TypeScript 2, we're slowly but steadily moving to embrace  these important new players in the  web development scene. We keep supporting the Angular 1 based devon4ng framework and are planning a migration of this framework to Angular 2 in the near future. For "Balu" we've have decided to integrate "vanilla" Angular 2.

We have migrated the Restaurant Sample application to serve as a, documented and supported, blueprint for Angular 2 applications. Furthermore, we support three "kickstarter" projects which help engagement getting started with Angular2 - either using Bootstrap or Google´s Material Design - or, alternatively, Ionic 2 (the mobile framework on top of Angular 2).

[[release-notes-version-2.1.asciidoc_devon4j-2.2.0-release]]
=== devon4j 2.2.0 Release

A new release of devon4j, version 2.2.0, is included in this release of devonfw. This release mainly focuses on server side of devonfw. i.e devon4j.

Major features added are :

* Upgrade to Spring Boot 1.3.8.RELEASE
* Upgrade to Apache CXF 3.1.8
* Database Integration with Oracle 11g
* Added Servlet for HTTP-Debugging
* Refactored code and improved JavaDoc
* Bugfix: mvn spring-boot:run executes successfully for devon4j application created using devon4j template
* Added subsystem tests of SalesmanagementRestService and several other tests
* Added Tests to test java packages conformance to devonfw conventions

More details on features added can be found at https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/milestone/19?closed=1(here). The devon4j wiki and other documents are updated for release 2.2.0.

[[general_release-notes-version-2.1.asciidoc_devon4sencha_3]]
=== Devon4Sencha

Devon4Sencha is an alternative view layer for web applications developed with devonfw. It is based on Sencha Ext JS. As it requires a license for commercial applications it is not provided as Open Source and is considered to be part of the IP of Capgemini.

These libraries provide support for creating SPA (Single Page Applications) with a very rich set of components for both desktop and mobile. In the new version we extend this functionality to support for "Universal Apps", the Sencha specific term for true multi-device applications which make it possible to develop a single application for desktop, tablet as well as mobile devices. In the latest version Devon4Sencha has been upgraded to support Ext JS 6.2 and we now support the usage of Cobigen as well as Sencha Architect as extra option to improve developer productivity.

[[general_release-notes-version-2.1.asciidoc_devcon-enhancements_4]]
=== Devcon enhancements

The Devon Console, Devcon, is a cross-platform command line tool running on the JVM that provides many automated tasks around the full life-cycle of Devon applications, from installing the basic working environment and generating a new project, to running a test server and deploying an application to production. It can be used by the engagements to integrate with their proprietary tool chain.

In this new release we have added an optional graphical user interface (with integrated help) which makes using Devcon even easier to use. Another new feature is that it is now possible to easily extend it with commands just by adding your own or project specific Javascript files. This makes it an attractive option for project task automation.

[[release-notes-version-2.1.asciidoc_ready-for-the-cloud]]
=== Ready for the Cloud

devonfw is in active use in the Cloud, with projects running on IBM Bluemix and on Amazon AWS. The focus is very much to keep Cloud-specific functionality decoupled from the devonfw core. The engagement can choose between - and easily configure the use of - either CloudFoundry or Spring Cloud (alternatively, you can run devonfw in Docker containers in the Cloud as well. See elsewhere in the release notes).

[[release-notes-version-2.1.asciidoc_spring-data]]
=== Spring Data

The java server stack within devonfw, devon4j,  is build on a very solid DDD architecture  which uses JPA for its data access layer. We now offer integration of Spring Data as an alternative or to be used in conjunction with JPA. Spring Data offers significant advantages over JPA through its query mechanism which allows the developer to specify complex queries in an easy way. Overall working with Spring Data should be quite more productive compared with JPA for the average or junior developer. And extra advantage is that Spring Data also allows - and comes with support for - the usage of NoSQL databases like MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB etc. THis becomes especially critical in the Cloud where NoSQL databases typically offer better scalability than relational databases.

[[release-notes-version-2.1.asciidoc_videos-content-in-the-devonfw-guide]]
=== Videos content in the devonfw Guide

The devonfw Guide is the single, authoritative tutorial and reference ("cookbook") for all things devonfw, targeted at the general developer working with the platform (there is another document for Architects).  It is clear and concise but because of the large scope and wide reach of devonfw, it comes with a hefty 370+ pages. For the impatient - and sometimes images do indeed say more than words - we've added videos to the Guide which significantly speed up getting started with the diverse aspects of devonfw.

For more information on videos check out our https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtb1p-24jus-QoXy49t9Xzg[devonfw Youtube channel]

[[release-notes-version-2.1.asciidoc_containerisation-with-docker-and-the-production-line]]
=== Containerisation with Docker and the Production Line

Docker (see: https://www.docker.com/) containers wrap a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything needed to run: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries – anything that can be installed on a server. Docker containers resemble virtual machines but are far more resource efficient. Because of this, Docker and related technologies like Kubernetes are taking the Enterprise and Cloud by storm. We have certified and documented the usage of devonfw on Docker so we can now firmly state that "devonfw is Docker" ready. All the more so as the iCSD Production Line is now supporting devonfw as well. The Production Line is a Docker based set of methods and tools that make possible to develop custom software to our customers on time and with the expected quality. By having first-class support for devonfw on the Production Line, iCSD has got an unified, integral solution which covers all the phases involved on the application development cycle from requirements to testing and hand-off to the client.

[[release-notes-version-2.1.asciidoc_eclipse-neon]]
=== Eclipse Neon

devonfw comes with its own pre configured and enhanced Eclipse based IDE:  the Open Source "devonfw IDE" and "devonfw Distr" which falls under Capgemini IP. We've updated both versions to the latest stable version of Eclipse, Neon. From Balu onwards we support the IDE on Linux as well and we offer downloadable versions for both Windows and Linux.

See: https://github.com/devonfw/ide/wiki[The Devon IDE]

[[release-notes-version-2.1.asciidoc_default-java-8-with-java-7-compatibility]]
=== Default Java 8 with Java 7 compatibility

From version 2.1. "Balu" onwards, devonfw is using by default Java 8 for both the tool-chain as well as the integrated development environments. However, both the framework as well as the IDE and tool-set remain fully backward compatible with Java 7. We have added documentation to help configuring aspects of the framework to use Java 7 or to upgrade existing projects to Java 8. See: https://github.com/devonfw/devon/wiki/Compatibility-guide-for-Java7,-Java8-and-Tomcat7,-Tomcat8[Compatibility guide for Java7, Java8 and Tomcat7, Tomcat8]

[[release-notes-version-2.1.asciidoc_full-linux-support]]
=== Full Linux support

In order to fully support the move towards the Cloud, from version 2.1. "Balu" onwards, devonfw is fully supported on Linux. Linux is the de-facto standard for most Cloud providers. We currently only offer first-class support for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS onward but most aspects of devonfw should run without problems on other and older distributions as well.

[[release-notes-version-2.1.asciidoc_initial-atom-support]]
=== Initial ATOM support

Atom is a text editor that's modern, approachable, yet hackable to the core - a tool you can customize to do anything but also use productively without ever touching a config file. It is turning into a standard for modern web development. In devonfw 2.1 "Balu" we provide a script which installs automatically the most recent version of Atom in the devonfw distribution with a pre-configured set of essential plugins.

[[release-notes-version-2.1.asciidoc_database-support]]
=== Database support

Through JPA (and now Spring Data as well) devonfw supports many databases. In Balu we've extended this support to prepared configuration, extensive documentations and supporting examples for all major "Enterprise" DB servers. So it becomes even easier for engagements to start using these standard database options. Currently we provide this extended support for Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL and PostgreSQL.
For more information see: https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/wiki/guide-database-migration[devonfw Database Migration Guide]

[[release-notes-version-2.1.asciidoc_internationalisation-i18n-improvements]]
=== Internationalisation (I18N) improvements

Likewise, existing basic Internationalisation (I18N) support has been significantly enhanced through an new devonfw module and extended to support Ext JS and Angular 2 apps as well. This means that both server as well as client side applications can be made easily to support multiple languages ("locales"), using industry standard tools and without touching programming code (essential when working with teams of translators).

[[release-notes-version-2.1.asciidoc_asynchronous-http-support]]
=== Asynchronous HTTP support

Asynchronous HTTP is an important feature allowing so-called "long polling" HTTP Requests (for streaming applications, for example) or with requests sending large amounts of data. By making HTTP Requests asynchronous, devonfw server instances can better support these types of use-cases while offering far better performance.

[[release-notes-version-2.1.asciidoc_security-and-license-guarantees]]
=== Security and License guarantees

In devonfw security comes first. The components of the framework are designed and implemented according to the recommendations and guidelines as specified by OWASP in order to confront the top 10 security vulnerabilities.

From version 2.1 "Balu" onward we certify that devonfw has been scanned by software from "Black Duck". This verifies that devonfw is based on 100% Open Source Software (non Copyleft) and demonstrates that at moment of release there are no known, critical security flaws. Less critical issues are clearly documented.

[[release-notes-version-2.1.asciidoc_documentation-improvements]]
=== Documentation improvements

Apart from the previously mentioned additions and improvements to diverse aspects of the devonfw documentation, principally the devonfw Guide,  there are a number of other important changes. We've incorporated the Devon Modules Developer´s Guide which describes how to extend devonfw with its Spring-based module system. Furthermore we've significantly improved the Guide to the usage of web services. We've included a Compatibility Guide which details a series of considerations related with different version of the framework as well as Java 7 vs 8. And finally, we've extended the F.A.Q. to provide the users with direct answers to common, Frequently Asked Questions.
